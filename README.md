# An Analysis of Kickstarter campaigns 

## Analysis of Crowdfunding Data in Excel 

## Overview 

Louis is an up and coming playright trying to raise 10,000 dollars through crowdfunding for her play "Fever", and she would like to know the characteristics and variables that make each play successful in raising their crowdfunding goals. Therefore looks towards historical crowdfunding data in excel to find solutions to her objective of raising 10,000 for her play. Since fever is a play under the theatre category, she is specifically more interested in knowing how successful plays have been in the past in order to understand how well her successful her own crowdfunding campaign will be and what she needs to do to raise her desired goal. 

## Analysis and Challenge 
In order to perform the analysis in this data, I leveraged formulas such as VLOOKUP and COUNTIF, pivotables to analyse fundraising metrics such as outcomes, goals with a specific focus towards the play subcategory. I also created pivot charts, analyzing theatre outcomes by launch date through a line graph, finding out in which months crowdfunding campaigns fared better and which months worse, an important metric as it helps find out the best launch date for a crowdfunding campaign. We also analyzed outcomes based on goals to find out which campaigns were most likely to meet their goals and which campaigns were and visualized this data with another line graph.

Dealing with pivot charts and pivot tables ws fairly comfortable but the COUNTIF function can be fairly tricky sometimes especially depending on the number of the conditions in the function. We used COUNTIF to find out which plays met their crowdfunding goals and divdided their goals to twelve different categories, from less than 10,000 all the way to 50,000. 
Your written analysis must contain three sections:

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Analysis and Challenges: Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.
Results: Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
What are some limitations of this dataset?
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
