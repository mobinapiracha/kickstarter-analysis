# An Analysis of Kickstarter campaigns 

## Analysis of Crowdfunding Data in Excel 

## Overview 

Louis is an up and coming playright trying to raise 10,000 dollars through a crowdfunding campaign for her play "Fever", and she would like to know the characteristics and variables that make each play successful in raising their crowdfunding goals. Therefore she looks towards historical crowdfunding data in excel to find solutions to her objective of raising 10,000 for her play. Since fever is a play under the theatre category, she is specifically more interested in knowing how successful plays have been in the past in order to understand how well her successful her own crowdfunding campaign will be and what she needs to do to raise her desired goal. 

## Analysis and Challenge 
In order to perform the analysis in this data, I leveraged formulas such as VLOOKUP and COUNTIF, pivotables to analyse fundraising metrics such as outcomes, goals with a specific focus towards the play subcategory. I also created pivot charts, analyzing theatre outcomes by launch date through a line graph, finding out in which months crowdfunding campaigns were more successful and which montrhs they failed, an important metric as it helps find out the best launch date for a crowdfunding campaign. We also analyzed outcomes based on goals to find out which campaigns were most likely to meet their goals and which ones failed, and visualized this data with another line graph. 

Dealing with pivot charts and pivot tables was fairly comfortable but the COUNTIFS function can be fairly tricky sometimes especially depending on the number of the conditions in the function. We used COUNTIFs to find out which plays met their crowdfunding goals and divdided theIR goals to twelve different categories, from less than 10,000 categpry to the greater than 50,000 category. Once I got comfortable with using pivot tables and pivot charts analysis and visualization of data became easier. 

## Results 

### Theatre Outcomes By Launch Date

The following chart is a month by month time series analysis showing theatre outcomes based on a crowdfunding campaign's launch date. As you can see, there is a significant peak in outcomes that are successful in the month of May with more than 100 successful campaigns in the theatre category. Generally, late April to mid July looks like the best time to launch a campaign as the count of successful outcomes is over 80 throughout this period. On the other hand, December has the lowest number of successful crowdfunding campaigns, as the number of successful campaigns is equal to number of failed campaigns, but it does look like in general the overall number of campaigns are lower in December. It looks like that generally the October to December period is the worst time for a crowdfunding campaign. Despite seeing a short spike in October for successful campaigns, there is a much larger spike for failed campaigns, October being the month for the largest number of failed campaigns. Therefore the recommendation would be to have a launch date in early to mid May to give Fever the best chance to meeting its fundraising goals. 

### Outcomes based on Goals

The following chart is an analysis of the outcome of each crowdfunding based on its goal, we provide 12 different categories of goal from less than 10,000 dollars to 50,000 dollars. This graph is interesting as it doesn't show any definite trend. For goals less than 10,000 the likelihood of success is very high, almost 80% but as the goal amount increases the likelihood of success decreases, at the 15000 to 19999 dollars point the success failure ratio is basically 50:50, as we continue from there the divergence rises until it reaches the 25000 to 29000 dollar which is basically one of the low points in the graph. We see some ups and downs after that but something about the validity of the data has to be said. We have a decent number of projects in the all the categories number up to the 20,000 to 24999 categories which has 20 projects, but after that range, there is just not enough data, other than 30,000 to 34999 and greater than 50,000 dollar range which have total counts of 11 and 16 respectively, dollar range each of all other categories have a total number of projects (both successful and failed) of less than double figures. Therefore, this chart has some accuracy up to the 24999 range, but we cannot estimate reliably after that point. Thankfully for Louis, her fundraising goal is 10,000 dollars which has a fairly high success rate of 20%. Therefore, unless Louis plans on doing plays in the future with a higher fundraising goal of greater than 25000 dollars, she shouldn't be concern on the other half of the chart, which is full of anomalous trends.  

### Limitations

The dataset has a number of limitations, the first one being mentioned above about the lack of data when it comes to fundraising goals above the 25000 goal range. Charts can be fairly misleading if we only have data points in the single digits as they will not give a fairly accurate picture due lack of observations. Therefore, it is important to ensure when analyzing data, it has a large number of observations (preferably over 30) and also ensure data has been properly collected. The second problem in this data is that even though the goal amount and the launch date may play a role in the success of a Crowdfunding campaign but there are other very important variables such as the brand and reputation of the writer which may not be easily measured. The location of the performance also needs to be taken into account, and the city where the campaign is taking place, there could also be marketing expenditures to support the crowdfunding campaigns which are not included in the dataset. However, the most important of all there is no genre, there is a way through we can categorize each campaign by looking the the blurb variable and categorize this data into different genres such as horror, comedy, action etc. When looking at a play some genres may be more popular than others especially in some cities and therefore it is important to analyze these variables by genre and importantly have a genre variable.

### Improvements 

Other possible tables or graphs that could be created would be to analyze success of a campaign based on its averge donation, this will allow us to see the average donations of campaigns that succeeded versus the ones that failed. Another option is to see success and failure by country to see in which country had the most successful campaigns. As mentioned earlier, if possible, we can create a genre variable to analyze success based on each genre, which will help us find out the chances of fever's success by looking at past plays in similar genres. Lastly, due to massive amount of data we have logistic regression could also be possibly used to analyze the success, by creating two success, failure binary variables in a logistic regression model.
